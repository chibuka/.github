**the real problem:** most coding practice platforms teach you to solve puzzles, not build actual software. you end up great at optimizing algorithms nobody uses but terrible at building real systems that people actually need.


## why this matters for you

traditional leetcode-style platforms prepare you for interviews, not engineering. they teach you to:
- solve algorithmic puzzles in 45 minutes
- optimize for time complexity no one actually cares about
- write code that runs once and gets thrown away

but when you actually build software, you need to:
- understand how systems work under the hood
- debug real production issues
- build things that handle edge cases you didn't anticipate
- write code that other people will maintain

write code in your favorite editor, test locally, submit when ready.
