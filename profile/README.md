## we're fed up with leetcode shenanigans!

we've all been there. grinding leetcode problems that have zero connection to actual software engineering. when's the last time you reversed a binary tree at work? never? exactly.

**the real problem:** most coding practice platforms teach you to solve puzzles, not build actual software. you end up great at optimizing algorithms nobody uses but terrible at building real systems that people actually need.

## what we're building instead

a coding platform that teaches you to build **real software**:
- tcp servers 
- http parsers 
- database engines
- compilers
etc...

no more "find the missing number in an array in o(n ^1/3)". 

**got ideas for challenges?** drop them in issues. we're always looking for more real-world systems.
