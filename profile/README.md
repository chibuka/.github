# 95

**the real problem:** most coding practice platforms teach you to solve puzzles, not build actual software. you end up great at optimizing algorithms nobody uses but terrible at building real systems that people actually need.


## why this matters for you

traditional leetcode-style platforms prepare you for interviews, not engineering. they teach you to:
- solve algorithmic puzzles in 45 minutes
- optimize for time complexity no one actually cares about
- write code that runs once and gets thrown away

but when you actually build software, you need to:
- understand how systems work under the hood
- debug real production issues
- build things that handle edge cases you didn't anticipate
- write code that other people will maintain

**our challenges teach you how things actually work**

want to understand networking? build a tcp server from scratch.
confused about http? implement your own http parser.
curious how databases work? build a simple one.

you'll understand these systems deeply because you built them yourself.

**learn by building, not by memorizing**

our platform gives you:
- real-world projects that matter
- immediate feedback on your implementations
- the satisfaction of building something that actually works
- skills that transfer directly to your day job

write code in your favorite editor, test locally, submit when ready.

## getting started

1. browse challenges at [95](https://www.95ninefive.dev/)
2. pick a challenge (start with "build your own shell")
3. write your implementation locally
4. install the cli: `check 95-cli repo for more infos`
5. submit: `95 submit [submission code]`

> more challenges coming soon.
